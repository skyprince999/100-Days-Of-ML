This repo is part of my endavour to learn new techniques in ML and document it over time. 

Started it as a New Year resolution for 2020! Lets see how I finish it!  

Remember - "The lasting impact of technology (AI/ML) isn't any specific product or feature that will be built. But on how it will enable people to live a better life."


Started this journey on 1st Jan 2020 

Currently @ the half way mark - 10th July 2020 
Completed 33 days of Machine Learning (ie 1/3rd of the target)
