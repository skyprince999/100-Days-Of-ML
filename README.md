# 100 Days Of Machine Learning

Do you believe....

That we walk on the shoulders of Giants!

That this is the new renaissance? 

Where we use Code to create a New World order!

This repo is part of my endavour to learn new techniques in ML and document it over time. 

Started as a New Year resolution! Let's see how I finish it!  

Remember - "The lasting impact of technology (AI/ML) isn't any specific product or feature that will be built. But on how it will enable people to live a better life."
