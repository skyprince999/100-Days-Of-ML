# 100 Days Of Machine Learning

Do you believe that we are walking on the shoulder of Giants! That this is the new renaissance? Where we are using code to create a new world order! 

This repo is part of my endavour to learn new things and document it over time. Started it as my New Year resolution for 2020! Lets see how I finish it!  

Remember - "The lasting impact of technology (AI/ML) isn't any specific product or feature that will be built. But on how it will enable people to live a better life."


Started this journey on 1st Jan 2020 

Currently @ the half way mark - 10th July 2020 and completed 33 days of Machine Learning (ie 1/3rd of the target)
